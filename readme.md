This repository holds the code for my personal website, as well as the
build system for it.

The site is built on [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/), and uses
[ZURB's gulp-based build system](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template).

The site can be found at [joepaolicelli.com](http://joepaolicelli.com).
